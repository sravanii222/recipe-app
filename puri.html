   <h2>Tips:</h2>

    <h3 class="puri">Ingredents:</h3>
    <p class="wheat"> .3 cups whole wheat flour – 360 grams</p>
  <p class="wheat">. 1 teaspoon oil or melted ghee (optional)</p>
   <p class="wheat">. 1 teaspoon salt or add as required</p>
   <p class="wheat">. ¾ to 1 cup water or add as required</p>
   <p class="wheat">. oil for deep frying – as required</p>
    <h3 class="cook">Instructions:</h3>
    <p class="mix">. In a mixing bowl or on your work-surface, take the whole wheat flour, salt and oil or melted ghee.</p>
   <p class="mix">. Add little water at a time and knead well to form a dough. The dough should not be soft but stiff and tight. You can also make a semi-soft dough.</p>
   <p class="mix">Assembling and rolling:</p>
   <p class="mix">. Divide the dough into small or medium pieces – about 25 to 30
    Make into medium sized or slightly small balls.</p>
   <p class="mix">. Spread a bit of oil on both sides of the dough ball. Spreading oil and not dusting with flour helps the oil to stay clean and you won’t see dark burnt flour particles inside the oil.</p>
   <p class="mix">. Roll the dough evenly into circles of about ¼ inch – neither too thin nor thick.</p>
  <P class="mix">. Place the rolled poori in a plate and cover with a clean kitchen towel, so that they don’t dry up.</P>
   <p class="mix">. Frying:</p>
   <p class="mix">. Heat oil in a deep frying pan or kadai.</p>
   <p class="mix">. When the oil is sufficiently hot then add one poori at a time and fry gently pressing down with the frying spoon or slotted spoon in a circular motion.</p>
    <p class="mix">. Turn over when puffed up and fry till golden brown.</p>
   <p class="mix">. Serve poori hot with a vegetable curry like korma or sweet dishes like suji ka halwa or aamras or potato curry.</p>
