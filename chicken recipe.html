    <p class="tip">Tips:</p> 
    <p class="recipe">Chicken:</p>
    <div>
      <li class="instructions"> The meat has to be tender. Which means the bird has to be lesser than one kilo. Then the flavours would be properly absorbed.<br>
      <li class="instructions">The pieces should be slightly big for the Pulao.</li>
       <li class="instructions">If you soak the Chicken in salt water for about half an hour before cooking, the meat becomes soft.</li>
       <li class="instructions"> If the Chicken is fried on high flame, the water will evaporate and the piece would be cooked. So it should be fried until it loses its moisture completely.</li></div>
        <h2 class="how">Basmati Rice:</h2>
       <p class="how"> People usually ask me what brand Basmati Rice I use. And I always answer that I use Rice that is older than one year. There are many good brands in the market. All noted brands have good quality Rice.</p>
   <p class="how">Rice will cook well if it is washed thoroughly and soaked for 30 minutes.</p>
        <p class="how">If you are making Chicken Pulao with Basmati Rice in a Pressure Cooker, then water is sufficient in the ratio of 1:1 1/2</p>
        <p class="how"> If it is Sona Masuri Rice you are using, then the water should be in 1:2 ratio.</p>
<h2 class="how">How to get the Rice in Pulao to be non-sticky and fluffy:</h2>
<p class="how">The Basmati Rice should be older than one year.</p>
<p class="how">Basmati/Sona Masuri whatever the Rice you choose, it has to be soaked for 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="how"> Basmati Rice gets cooked on high flame within two whistles. Sona Masuri needs 2 whistles on high flame and 1 whistle on sim.</p>
<p class="how"> Once the whistles are done, switch off the stove and leave it for 20 minutes. Then if you turn it over with a flat spoon gently, the grains come off intact without breaking.</p>
<h3 class="how">Finallyâ€¦</h3>
<p class="how"> The Pulao I am making has medium spices. You could adjust salt and spice as per your taste.</p>
